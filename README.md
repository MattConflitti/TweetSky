# TweetSky

TweetSky is a ReactNative app that Danny DeRuiter, David Calkins, and I are developing for our software engineering class at GVSU. We were able to convince our professor to veer away from classic Java and allow us to develop our project in a newer framework. The app is still in development and release 1 is scheduled for March 2nd, 2017 and release 2 in April 2017. More images and gifs will be posted as they become available. The app utilizes Redux for the data store and model. The plan for release two is to integrate NativeBase styling to really make the app looks clean and professional. This first release is to merely be functional. The app's funcitonality is to hook into the Twitter API to get tweets based on user, phrase, or hashtag. We then process those tweets and produce a great looking word cloud for the user (hence, making a TweetSky of word clouds.)

More to come!
